#The Christmas gift collection  
It’s Boxing-day, at the local bar you see a person that looks familiar, with a large beard and a  red coat, you realise that it’s Santa. Santa seems busy chatting with the bartender so you  sneak up to a spot nearby to listen in on the conversation. Santa tells the bartender about the  disaster that happened last night. Somewhere over Sydney, the bag of Christmas gifts broke  and the Christmas gifts are now scattered all over town.    You quickly map up Sydney in a grid and make a plan of attack to try to find the gifts. A robot,  given a set of instructions, is the obvious collector of the gifts.  With a list of movements, up, down, left and right (​ U​ ,​ D​ ,​ L​ ,​ R​ ) the robot walks the city in the hunt  for gifts.     Given a dimension n of the grid. (The robot cannot walk outside off the grid)  Given a starting position (x, y). (Top left corner is ​ (x: 0, y: 0)​ )  Given a list of positions of gifts (x, y)(x, y)(x, y)  Given a list of instructions  (​ U​​ D​ L​​ R​ )    Your task is to program the robot to take an input in the given format and output the number of  gifts found where the robot can be found.    Example input:  4  0,0  0,1 1,2 2,0 3,2  DDRDRUUU    Example output:  3 presents  Robot can be found at (2, 0)
